## Customer-Care-Audio-Calls-Conversion-to-Text-AWSTranscribe

## Objective

Today when we have abundance of service centre data available to us and a lot of human-power invested in doing it, we can utilise machine learning techniques to make this service better. We can create a managed system for the calls. Some of requirements of the cutomers are demand repetitive tasks, we can find them out and eliminate human interactions by putting in machines to do those tasks. We can create an automatic system to do the routine works efficiently. It will also be error free. 

## Data
.wav file in any input bucket on Amazon S3

## Library
boto3, pandas, wave, audioop

## Note
I have also created a script for decibel conversion of the audio urls. They can help in making the service better, help us in finding anamolies and could work as features in modelling.
